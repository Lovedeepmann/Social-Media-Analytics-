# Social-Media-Analytics using LSTM-
Sentiment Analysis is a machine learning method that can determine whether a specific statement is positive or negative. This technique is most widely used in analyzing customer reviews or feedback. The data required in sentiment analysis must be specific and has huge volume.

Project Objective : - The main objective of this proposal is to generate a sentiment analysis for different mobile networks reviews using streaming data from social media platforms such as Twitter and then develop a model to classify sentiments.

Methodlogies : - 1. Data Collection and Preparation, 2. Machine Leaning Model, 3. Implementing Tensorflow based model for training 

Conclusion
• We used the tweepy and fetch the data from the twitter explored the data in different ways.
• We prepared the text data of tweets by removing the unnecessary things.
• We trained the model based on machine learning model and on TensorFlow with all settings
• We evaluated the model with different evaluation measures
• We compare the mobile network using the Bar graph and pie chart
